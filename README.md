# TorCash version 0.1.4.4
TorCash is originally a fork of Zcash, with many modules from Monero professionally coded together in harmory, instead of code clashing together.

After much development, TorCash now has functions from Zcash, Monero and DASH - all coded from the ground up to make the most stable combination of the best privacy features available.

With future development and stability in mind, our development team is always hungry for better code. Programming together as a team - we get work done creatively, professionally, and with a mix of skills from everyone on the development team. We are an active, progressive, and democrative team with great goals for the future.

# Updates in version 0.1.4.4
Many flaws in the connection settings/functions were fixed. Entire functions were re-written and re-made.
Minor Bugs in Import/Export of key fixed

# What is TorCash

TorCash is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol. Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata. Technical details are available in our Protocol Specification.

This software is the TorCash client. It downloads and stores the entire history of TorCash transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the blockchain has reached a significant size.

### TorCash is experimental and a work-in-progress. Use at your own risk.

# Deprecation Policy
This release is considered deprecated 16 weeks after the release day. There is an automatic deprecation shutdown feature which will halt the node some time after this 16 week time period. The automatic feature is based on block height and can be explicitly disabled.

# Building
Build Zcash along with most dependencies from source by running ./zcutil/build.sh. Currently only Linux is officially supported.
